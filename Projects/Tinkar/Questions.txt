1) Java instant. Currently Instant nano seconds is serialized.
   C# DateTime only resolved to 100 nanoseconds, so any conversion 
   between c# and java will lose precision of nanosecond.
   Do we need fractional second resolution in time? If we do, can we resolve to
   millisconds or 100 nanoseconds? If not, then we need C# instant class.

2) Porting is being done to C# 9.0 and .net core 5.0. Do we need 4.7.X framework version?
   .net 5 has Records and default interface methods.

3) How strict should java and csharp extensions map?
   i.e. can we get rid of UncheckedIOException and such?

4) 	public IEnumerable<Object> SemanticVersionDTO.Fields { get; init; }
	What is this used for?
	What are restrictions to objects put into Fields?
	Can this be anything, or is it limites to certain types?

5)	ConceptChronologyDTO
	ConceptChronologyDTO.Make always creates identical ConceptVersionDTO items. Is
	this intentional or just incomplete?

6)	SemanticChronologyDTO
	DefinitionForSemanticChronologyDTO
	Same as 5.
